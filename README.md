# RRChatBot

This repository contains an innovative iOS app that integrates the ChatGPT API to create personalized assistants capable of answering FAQs or providing information from specific datasets. The app showcases five unique assistants:

### Features
- **Resume Assistant**: Input your resume, and the assistant will respond to any question about your career, skills, or experiences.
- **Company-Specific FAQ Agents**:
  - Tesla: Provides answers based on Tesla's Terms and Conditions.
  - LinkedIn: Responds to questions derived from LinkedIn's Terms and Conditions.
  - Swiggy: Clarifies FAQs using Swiggy's Terms and Conditions.
  - Netflix: Answers queries related to Netflix's Terms and Conditions.

### Demo
This project uses the official Terms and Conditions of Tesla, LinkedIn, Swiggy, and Netflix as input data for their respective FAQ agents. These agents can provide insightful and context-aware responses tailored to their datasets.
